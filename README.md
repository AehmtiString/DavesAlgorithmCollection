# Dave's Algorithm Collection

This repository is a collection of common algorithms from an algorithms and datastructures class.
All algorithms are implemented in Java and are NOT thread safe.

## On the state of these algorithms
These algorithms were implemented with the goal to experiment with them and many of them were implemented from scratch from my memory (implementing what I could still remember from class). This repo is by no means complete / tested / safe to use. However, if you want to take a glimpse feel free to use my code as long as it complies with the MIT license.


## Implemented Algorithms:
*Sorting*:
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort

*Searching*:


## License
All the code in this repo is licensed under the permissive MIT license.
