# Dave's Algorithm Collection

This repository is a collection of common algorithms from an algorithms and datastructures class.
All algorithms are implemented in Java and are NOT thread safe.

## On the state of these algorithms
These algorithms were implemented with the goal to experiment with them and many of them were implemented from scratch from my memory (implementing what I could still remember from class). This repo is by no means complete / tested / safe to use.
*Seriously: Using this code is really dangerous.* 
However, if you want to take a glimpse feel free to use my code as long as it complies with the MIT license.
