# Dave's Algorithm Collection

This repository is a collection of common algorithms from an algorithms and datastructures class.
All algorithms are implemented in Java and are NOT thread safe.

## On the state of these algorithms
These algorithms were implemented with the goal to experiment with them and many of them were implemented from scratch from my memory (implementing what I could still remember from class). This repo is by no means complete / tested / safe to use. However, if you want to take a glimpse feel free to use my code as long as it complies with the MIT license.


## Implemented Algorithms:

**Datastructures**:
 - AVL Tree
 - LinkedList
 - Queue
 - Stack

**Dynamic Programming**
- Knapsack
- CoinChange
- StockOptimum
- Paragraph Formatting / Optimal Line Break

**Graphs**:
- *Graph Datastructures*
	- Graph interface
	- Adjacency list based graph class
	- Matrix based graph class
	- Weighted matrix graph class
	- Union Find (using arrays)
- *Simple Algorithms*
	- Depth first search
	- Breadth first search
- *Shortest Paths*
	- none yet ☹️
- *Minimal Spanning Trees*
	- none yet ☹️

**Sorting**:
- Selection Sort
- HeapSort
- Bubble Sort
- Sequential Merge Sort
- IsSorted, a small program checking whether a given array is sorted.

**Searching**:
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Exponential Search
- Interpolation Search
